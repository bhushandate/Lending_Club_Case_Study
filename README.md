## Introduction:

A **consumer finance company** has provided data of old customers for analysis. This company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
 - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

 - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Business Objectives
When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:

- Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

     1. **Fully paid:** Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

     2. **Current:** Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.

     3. **Charged-off:** Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 

- Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)

## Content of Case study
The motive behind this case study is to apply aquired knowledge of Exploratory Data Analysis to find out insights related to loan defaulting based on provioded data.
<br>The steps used for analysis are as follows

1. Data Importing & understanding
2. Data Cleaning & formatting
3. Data Sanity Checking
4. Data Imputing
5. Outlier treatment
6. Data Analysis<br>
           > Univariate Analysis <br>
           > Segmented Univariate Analysis<br>
           > Bivariate Analysis<br>
           > Multivariate Analysis<br>

## Conclusions

Factors deciding loan defaulters are as follow,
 
<br>Purpose - Small business 
<br>Loan with high interest rate
<br>Person in Grade F
<br>Persons not having home
<br>Persons with less income
<br>Person living in NV state - 891xx zip code
<br>Loan with longer term of loan
<br>Persons with high dti
<br>Persons with more Revolving balance utilization
